Korean Ferry is an interactive news and data visualization work for the South Korean Ferry Disaster. Almost 300 people remain unaccounted for after a ferry carrying 459 people capsized and sank off South Korea. This project has been developed to show the events happened around the South Korea Ferry Disaster. The timeline focuses more on the actions of the South Korean government and news media than on the investigation into the cause of the accident, rescue efforts or international reactions. It is an effort to comprehend the social and political reforms followed and/or brought by the disaster. Thus, in order to provide an objective view on all events as possible, the timeline only contains articles from foreign press.
